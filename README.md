# Game ![Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/bobpaw/game.svg?branch=master)
`game` is/will be in the future a text-based RPG game with ncurses.

`xml` reads `items.xml` and prints out the data.

The directory life is mostly self contained and has the `life` program.
It runs arbitrary cellular automata.

To anybody editing it, I'd recommend running "make maintainer-clean" before committing. :)
